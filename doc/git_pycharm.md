# PyCharm and GitHub
-with Raspberry Pi projects

## Introduction

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/){:target="_blank"} Is a Lightweight IDE for Python & Scientific development.

[GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.(WIKI)

If you combine these two products / services, you will get a more fluent workflow developing and testing code on your raspberry pi. Hopefully this small guide will get you started. If you run into problems or have ideas for changes, please contact me:
