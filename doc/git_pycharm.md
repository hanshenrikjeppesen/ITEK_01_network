# PyCharm and GitHub
-with Raspberry Pi projects

## Introduction

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/){:target="_blank"} Is a Lightweight IDE for Python & Scientific development.

[GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.(Wiki)

Try looking at this page for more info ["What Is GitHub, and What Is It Used For?"](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/)

If you combine these two products / services, you will get a more fluent workflow developing and testing code on your raspberry pi. Hopefully this small guide will get you started. If you run into problems or have ideas for changes, please contact me:

## Installation

- First of course we must install `PyCharm` on Windows, Linux or MacOS [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
- We also need to install `Git` - try looking at this [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- If you don’t already have a `GitHub account`, you will need to setup a user account [link](https://github.com/)
- You need to do a Git installation on the raspberry as well

## Step 1 - Git(Hub) setup

Let’s take it one step at a time. When you have installed PyCharm and Git on your computer and you have made a user account on GitHub, we are almost ready to go.

You will need to make a repository in GitHub for your project [link](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/)

When you have the GitHub repository, you can make a new file and call it a name for instance `test.py` [link]( https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/)

## Step 2 PyCharm

Now we are ready to open and work on the file `test.py`
